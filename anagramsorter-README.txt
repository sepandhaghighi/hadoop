This project use hadoop framework to run map/reduce code written in python.
Each map/reduce application has 2 main class mapper and reducer. In map
step each worker node applies the "map()" function to the local data, and
writes the output to a temporary storage. A master node ensures that only
one copy of redundant input data is processed. In reduce step worker nodes
now process each group of output data, per key, in parallel.

Anagram sorter project consists of two files reducer.py and mapper.py.

Mapper Class
---------------------------------------
Mapper class first get input file from sys.stdin(argument passing in terminal -input input.txt)
then pass this file to read_input function, this function read each line of file and convert
it to lower case and split word by word ( by regular expression for input files with more than one word in each line)
then yield each splited line as a list of words (return in each iteration).
For each word in input file print sorted word(by letter) and unsorted word separated by separator variable (default horizontal tab).

Reducer Class
---------------------------------------
Reducer class first call read_mapper_output function to get input data line by line from sys.stdin (argument passing in terminal , data generated by mapper in prev step)
then group this input data by first item(sorted word) and append words with same sorted face to a separated list and append each separated list to lager final list
in final step call sort function to sort large list and print each item of this list.
This sort function, sort list of lists by length of each list (method : selection sort)
